research.KNOWLEDGETYPES.title=Research
research.KNOWLEDGETYPES.stage.1=Before you can build most thaumaturgical items and blocks, you first need to discover how to do so. There are several steps in this process:<BR>(1) Exploring the world and examining blocks, items and creatures with a §5Thaumometer§0<BR>(2) Taking the research points you gathered from the first step and expanding your aspect knowledge with the §5Research Table§0<BR>(3) Using the aspects you know and discovering practical knowledge and recipes with the §5Research Table§0.<BR>§l       §nExploration§r<BR>You cannot perform research without research points, and the best way to gain research points is by exploration and examining objects in the world.<BR>The first thing you will need to do is construct a §5Thaumometer§0 (see next page). By pointing the §5Thaumometer§0 at objects or creatures and holding the right mouse button you will start examining them. The process does not take long, but your movement speed is reduced while it is occurring.<BR>Once complete the §5Thaumometer§0 will display what aspects the object contains. In the bottom right of the screen you will also see a summary of the aspects and research points you discovered. You will initially not be able to examine all objects since you have not discovered their component aspects. For example, an object containing the Lux aspect<IMG>oldresearch:textures/misc/research1.png:0:0:255:208:.5</IMG>can only be examined if you have previously discovered the Lux aspect, or know the two aspects that combine to create it.<BR><BR><BR><BR>The very first time you discover an aspect by examining something you gain two more research points than you would have normally.<BR>Objects and creatures can usually only ever be examined once.<BR>Occasionally examining something will reveal additional clues and insights into thaumaturgical research, unlocking subjects that you can research further.<BR>Research discovered in this fashion will have amber icons.<BR><BR>§l   §nCombining Aspects§r<BR>Once you have gathered some research points you can attempt to combine them into compound aspects within a research table.<BR>To craft a research table simply place a §5wood table§0 and click on it with a set of Scribing Tools. The recipe for tables is listed under the §5Artiface§0 research category.<BR><BR><BR>If you open the research tables inventory, you will see an interface as pictured on the right.<BR>The scribing tools you used to craft the table will be located in slot §l1§r. You should see all the primal aspects (and possibly some compound aspects) listed in the area marked §l3§r with varying amounts attached to them. When you enter a world for the first time, every player is assigned a small pool of primal aspects to get them started. If you had done some exploring with the thaumometer beforehand then you might have a<IMG>oldresearch:textures/misc/research2.png:0:0:128:83:1</IMG>significant number of primal and compound aspects listed here.<BR>You can now start combining aspects into more complex compound aspects but simply clicking on those you wish to combine or dragging it to the runic circles in area §l4§r. The selected aspects will appear in area §l4§r and when you have two selected pressing the purple button will attempt to combine them. If successful you should see what was gained in the bottom right and it should appear in area §l3§r.<BR>The component aspects are consumed even if the combination did not result in valid compound aspect.<BR>§l    §nPrimary Research§r<BR>You need to be carrying a set of scribing tools and paper for this step.<BR>If you open your Thaumonomicon you will see<IMG>oldresearch:textures/misc/research2.png:0:88:255:158:.5</IMG>all the knowledge have and also all the knowledge that you are now able to pursue.<BR>Flashing square or round icons represent primary researches. If you can read their title (instead of seeing strange runes) you are simply able to click on them. Paper and ink will be consumed from your inventory and you will gain a research note. You can now take this research note to the table to start researching it by placing it in slot §l2§r.<BR>Section §l5§r will now display a sheet of paper covered in hexagonal tiles with aspect icons around the outer edge. If you see question mark icons it means you do not know that aspect yet and you will need to learn it first. To complete your research you simply need to connect and activate all the aspects. You do this by dragging an aspect to a hex adjacent to it that is either composed of the target aspect, or can be combined with another aspect to form the target aspect. Placing an aspect consumes one research point. If you make a mistake you can click on the aspect to remove it, but you will not regain the research point. You continue doing this until you have formed a pattern connecting all the starting aspects. The outer aspects need not be connected to all the others, they simply need to form a connected whole.<BR>Once this is done the research will complete and the research note will turn into a discovery. NOTE: Placing and removing aspects from the hex grid consumes ink from your scribing tools. If it runs out you will not be able to proceed until you refill it.<BR>§l   §nSecondary Research§r<BR>Hexagonal icons indicate Secondary research. Much like primary research you just need to click on them. However instead of gaining a research note, you will simply learn the research directly. Secondary research does have an aspect cost you need to pay, but they do not require you to be carrying scribing tools or paper.
